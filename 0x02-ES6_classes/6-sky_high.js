/**Import Building from 5-building.js.

Implement a class named SkyHighBuilding that extends from Building:

Constructor attributes:
sqft (Number) (must be assigned to the parent class Building)
floors (Number)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter for each attribute.
Override the method named evacuationWarningMessage and return the following string Evacuate slowly the NUMBER_OF_FLOORS floors. */
